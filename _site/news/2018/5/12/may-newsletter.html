<strong>Stardust Family United has been one of the most successful organizing campaigns taken on by the IWW in years.</strong> The have had great success, but need our help: They have racked up thousands of dollars in legal fees while fighting their organizing campaign.

<strong>IWOC has two crowd-funding campaigns: one for a Fellow Worker inside who has incurred legal fees while fighting abuses by correction officers and two Fellow Workers who were recently released.</strong> Please donate <a href="https://www.youcaring.com/kevinkraig-1169652">here</a> and <a href="https://www.youcaring.com/dralfatahstewart-1111915">here</a>.<br><br>

<strong>IWOC is picking up Jailhouse Lawyers Speak's call for a nation-wide prison strike from August 21 to September 9, and they need help planning solidarity actions, corresponding with inside contacts, and getting the word out to the media.</strong> Organizing meetings are currently every second Friday at 7 p.m., usually by phone, and the next one will be on Friday, May 19. If you'd like to join, please e-mail <a href="mailto:iwoc.nyc@riseup.net">iwoc.nyc@riseup.net</a>.<br><br>
