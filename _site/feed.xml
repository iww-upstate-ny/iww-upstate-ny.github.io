Its latest campaign focuses on Wendy's, which it is pushing to join the Fair Food Program, placing a small premium on tomatoes to fund higher wages, workplace audits, and worker-to-worker education.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;

In response to CIW's call for support, the NYC IWW is organizing a solidarity action on Saturday, October 27. Meeting at the Wendy's at 650 Broadway in Manhattan at 6:30 p.m., we will distribute flyers educating the public about the company's refusal to join the Fair Food Program and encourage a boycott until it does so.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;

      <title>The IWW's Feminist History</title>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;
&lt;em&gt;&quot;The IWW has been accused of putting the women in the front. The truth is, the IWW does not keep them in the back, and they go to the front.&quot; – Elizabeth Gurley Flynn, Wobbly, 1915&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;

The Industrial Workers of the World (IWW) is a democratic, rank-and-file labor organization dedicated to building workers' power on the job. Founded in 1905 in Chicago, the IWW was one of the first unions to take seriously the struggle for women's liberation, enshrining in its constitution that &quot;No worker shall be excluded from the IWW because of race, ethnicity, gender, nationality, creed, disability, sexual orientation, or any other non-economic criterion . . . .&quot; Helen Keller, Margaret Sanger, Mary Harris &quot;Mother&quot; Jones, Lucy Parsons, Dorothy Day, and other celebrated feminists have all been members of the IWW, or &quot;Wobblies.&quot;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;Join Us in Fighting for Immigrant Workers' Rights&lt;/h3&gt;

In addition to supporting women's liberation, the IWW has always fought for immigrant workers. In 2017, the IWW's New York City General Membership Branch (NYC GMB) supported workers at Tom Cat Bakery in Queens, who were targets of the first known I-9 audit under the Trump administration.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;

&lt;strong&gt;Tom Cat workers still need support! &lt;a href=&quot;https://wobblycity.org/contact/&quot;&gt;Contact us&lt;/a&gt; if you can volunteer to do consumer education or research!&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;

I-9 audits are conducted by US Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) to pressure employers to fire undocumented workers, further criminalizing immigrants, jeopardizing the well-being of families, and fueling poverty. I-9 audits have been used to terrorize thousands of workers, including those at Cloverhill Bakery in Chicago, Boathouse Canton in Baltimore, and 7-Elevens across the country. ICE Deputy Director Tom Horman recently stated that he aims to increase such operations by 400 percent.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;

&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Organize to Defend Women, Immigrants &amp; the Rest of the Working Class&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;

      <title>Resolution on Immigration and Customs Enforcement</title>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;
Whereas, the Industrial Workers of World have a longstanding tradition of organizing with immigrant workers; and&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;

Whereas, the Industrial Workers of the World New York City General Membership Branch has an active campaign in support of workers impacted by a workplace audit executed by Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE); and&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;

Whereas, the actions of ICE target the most vulnerable of the working class, splitting up families and incarcerating workers for trying to make a better life for themselves; and&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;

Whereas, ICE drives down the wages and working conditions of immigrant workers, attempts to pit immigrant and non-immigrant workers against each other, and is an obstacle to the progress of all working people; and&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;

Whereas, in New York City, ICE retaliated against protestors occupying the ICE Processing Center at 201 Varick Street by refusing to hold bond hearings for detainees or allow access to pro bono legal representation on June 26 and June 27, 2018; and&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;

Whereas, an injury to one is an injury to all; be it,&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;

Resolved, that the Industrial Workers of the World New York City General Membership Branch endorses the ICE facility occupations in New York City; and&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;

Resolved, that the Industrial Workers of the World New York City General Membership Branch demands the abolition of ICE and a return to open borders; and&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;

Resolved, that the Industrial Workers of the World New York City General Membership Branch opposes all cooperation between ICE and the New York City Police Department; and&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;

Resolved, that the Industrial Workers of the World New York City General Membership Branch will give material assistance to anti-ICE protests, civil disobedience, and other actions as we are able.

      <title>On Janus v. AFSCME</title>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;
Despite what gloating capitalists and defeatists progressives may say, the Supreme Court's decision in &lt;em&gt;Janus v. AFSCME&lt;/em&gt; is not the end of unions in the US.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;

Unions were not created by the stroke of a judge's pen nor will they be undone by it. Unions were forged in the flames of class war, against the interests of politicians and their lackeys, by working people who understood that we can only count on each other. Whenever and wherever workers act together to improve their working conditions, unions will prevail. No law can change this.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;

Capitalists seek to turn back the clock to 1934, to before the National Labor Relations Act gave unions legal protections? So be it. We welcome 1934. 1934 saw the ILA unionize all West Coast ports, Teamsters break into &quot;open shop&quot; Minneapolis, and textile workers from New England to the South launch what was the largest strike in US history. The NLRA was a compromise imposed by the government to prevent all out class war. If we are done compromising, then let us return to fighting.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;

But we don't need to look so far back for inspiration. In 2018, teachers in West Virginia proved that workers need only act together to succeed. WV teachers already lacked the protections that &lt;em&gt;Janus&lt;/em&gt; will strip from other unions. That did not stop them from winning their demands and inspiring workers across the country.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;

The Industrial Workers of the World was founded in 1905. For over 100 years, we have known that there can be no compromise between workers and bosses. Join us for the fight.
&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>The Silver Lining Behind &quot;Right to Work&quot; Legislation</title>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;
While the IWW recognizes that recent &quot;right to work&quot; legislation is a blatant attempt to bankrupt unions, we also see an opportunity for unions to respond by becoming militant and more democratic, as well as teaching members that a union can function quite well without the mandatory deduction of dues from paychecks. Indeed, unions were strongest long before the Taft-Hartley Act of 1947, which codified labor law, and proved that victories are not dependent on the dues check-off.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;

In the IWW, the dues check-off is unconstitutional and workers are encouraged to pay dues either directly to a delegate, online, or through the mail. When workers understand that there is value in their union, they will want to pay dues. And when workers have complete democracy in their union, they'll know that their vote controls exactly how their dues are spent. Worried about &quot;freeloaders?&quot; Let the workers handle this alleged problem—not the bosses or the state.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;

Union membership has continued to decline since the 1950s. How low does the percentage have to plummet before workers realize that unions need a new strategy to win? Only when workers know that they are the union, that they control how it operates and how the dues are collected and spent, will unions return to the fighting machines they once were.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;

Don't let the state convince you that it can end union membership simply by ending the dues check-off—history has shown otherwise!
&lt;/p&gt;

If you'd like to join, please e-mail &lt;a href=&quot;mailto:iwoc.nyc@riseup.net&quot;&gt;iwoc.nyc@riseup.net&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;

      <title>Call for a Juneteenth 2018 Mobilization Against Prison Slavery</title>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Call for a #Juneteenth2018 Mobilization Against Prison Slavery&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;br&gt;

&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.facebook.com/permalink.php?story_fbid=169646217040215&amp;id=133851070619730&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;from SPARC&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;

This year we, supporters of &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.facebook.com/hashtag/operationpush&quot;&gt;#OperationPUSH&lt;/a&gt;, are calling on all opponents of mass incarceration and modern-day slavery internationally to honor the Juneteenth holiday (Tuesday, June 19, 2018) with community organizing and direct action.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;

This call to action is inspired by prisoners in Texas and Florida, two of the largest and most repressive prison systems in the U.S., who remain active in freedom struggle against all odds.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;Background&lt;/h3&gt;

Juneteenth is an abolitionist holiday originating in Texas, where many Confederate slave-holders fled to during the U.S. Civil War.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;

But that war was not merely a domestic civil conflict. It was a flare-up of the global movement to end slavery. It is a movement that continues to challenge the slave relations of today which occur under several names (examples include debt bondage, sex trafficking, prison labor) and generally impact the most historically exploited and most vulnerable among us.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;

Forced captivity and involuntary labor have been among the most abhorrent practices in human society since the earliest of written records.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;

The celebration of freedom from these conditions has formed the foundation of many cultures and identities.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;

Juneteenth in particular marked the official end of chattel slavery in the U.S. But the backlash against this victory saw the initial formation of many state prison systems in the country, especially in the South, born to manage a new era of slavery known as convict-leasing. That system was also technically done away with, but its remnants are visible all over the country.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;

Prison slave labor today can be seen in wildlands firefighters, disaster clean-up from hurricanes and oil spills, massive contracts with cities, counties and universities, and the running of the prisons themselves.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;

While prisons no longer provide the same scale of labor that chattel slavery and convict-leasing did, they maintain the slave relation of captivity for another primary purpose: the warehousing of populations that pose a threat to a profit-obsessed society. This includes the unemployed or those in underground economies, the mentally ill, and those most likely to challenge the status quo.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;

The Juneteenth holiday originated in 1865, but the struggle for official recognition is still occurring today. As of May 2016, 45 of the 50 U.S. states and the District of Columbia have recognized Juneteenth as either a state holiday or a day of observance.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;

Juneteenth originally marked the freedom of African Americans from captivity. Today’s prison system has made slavery a multi-racial affair, where indigenous and immigrant people of all backgrounds are held in bondage along side the descendants of European settlers, joined by the common bond of poverty.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;

The aim of this call to action is to support the ongoing effort to recognize Juneteenth and to add to that legacy by calling for an end to modern-day slave conditions in the prison system.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;Goals&lt;/h3&gt;

1. End slave labor&lt;br&gt;
2. Stop profiteering off prisoners&lt;br&gt;
3. Reduce the prison population&lt;br&gt;
4. Demand environmental justice in the prison industrial complex&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;Strategy&lt;/h3&gt;

Plan outreach activities in the weeks leading up to, and actions in the days surrounding, Juneteeneth. Aim to put pressure on the prison system and build community support for ending mass incarceration.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;Specific Suggestions&lt;/h3&gt;

1. Host large public film showings of Ava Duvernay’s documentary 13th (available on Netflix) at spaces where people are likely to have not seen it yet and facilitate discussion afterward.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;

2. Coordinate letter writing/mass mailing parties to prisoners in your state where you aim to reach out to at least 500 new prisoners by gathering addresses off online rosters, communicating to prisoners that there will be public events around Juneteenth and encourage them to inform family and friends. (If these letters are censored, appeal the censorship and seek First Amendment attorneys to assist.)&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;

3. Plan actions that include highly visible street theater and civil disobedience that will attract media attention and disrupt business as usual. (If these include any risk of arrest, please prepare with trainings and bail funds.)&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;Context&lt;/h3&gt;

In January this year we saw an international outpouring of support for the Florida prisoners who called for the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.facebook.com/hashtag/operationpush&quot;&gt;#OperationPUSH&lt;/a&gt; prisoner strike. This came largely from networks developed around the 2016 Attica anniversary and the 2017 Black August organizing, as well as earlier coordinated prisoner-related efforts in Alabama, Texas, California, Georgia and elsewhere.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;

While we have developed strong relationships across the walls all around the country over these past two years, we have also learned some hard lessons about repression against prisoners from inside/outside organizing.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;

In response to efforts at increasing communication by mail and visits, we’ve seen retaliation via censorship and visitation cuts. We’ve also seen many solid organizers thrown into solitary confinement or shipped off to other prisons repeatedly, as well as random prisoners punished just for being sent activist mailings. And we’ve watched organizations be labeled as Security Threat Groups in order to scare new prisoners away from associating with the movement.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;

Still we have persevered, escalated and evolved our strategies. We have repeatedly heard that mainstream media coverage is a major inspiration to people inside, that it reaches more than our mail ever could. (It is also more difficult to censor.)&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;

For this reason, suggestion number three, disruption and civil disobedience is a priority for activities surrounding Juneteenth.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;Strategy&lt;/h3&gt;

We know the media operates on a mantra of “if it bleeds, it leads.” Although this often refers to literal bloodshed, it thankfully does not require it. Any conflict that makes it on to a police scanner has always been the media’s priority. While coverage doesn’t require mass arrests, zero arrests can often result in a demonstration that does not make it into the headlines.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;

Media also often ignores in-depth stories too far from its primary urban audiences.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;

Take for example the Operation PUSH solidarity action where around 50 people occupied the FDOC lobby for five hours, effectively shutting down the building’s normal operations. It wasn’t until police aggression, a broken window and an arrest that TV cameras showed up to tell the story.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;

Meanwhile, prisoners launched regular uprisings with brutal retaliation. Coverage of this is rare due to the rural, remote location of most prisons.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;

Taking note of recent movements like Black Lives Matter, Idle No More and the pipeline resistance at Standing Rock, along with historic examples in the civil rights, women’s suffrage and anti-nuclear movements, we’ve see that remote areas and under-reported issues can be brought front-and-center using civil disobedience and strategic disturbances.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;Talking points on the goals&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;br&gt;

&lt;strong&gt;End slave labor&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;

This means the prisoners around the world who do industrial work for little-to-no pay in kitchens, laundries, on road crews, in fields or in factories must get a fair wage for their labor, or the prisons must pay outside workers to do this work. One way or another, the true cost of prison operation must be known and the broken system of mass incarceration must no longer be subsidized through slavery. The U.S. acts appalled by other &lt;a href=&quot;http://money.cnn.com/2016/06/06/news/economy/china-prison-labor-exports/index.html&quot;&gt;countries like China exploiting its prisoners for free labor&lt;/a&gt;, but tolerates the practice at home.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;

&lt;strong&gt;Stop profiteering off prisoners&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;

All across the country, federal, state and municipal agencies contract with profit-driven companies for goods and services (on top of the prisons and detention centers where operations are handed over to private companies in attempt to cut costs). In most every instance of these contracts for healthcare, commissary, phones and money transfers, prisoners are price-gouged because they are captive customers.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;

&lt;strong&gt;Reduce prison populations&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;

State and federal officials can use re-sentencing, parole and clemency to drastically bring down the number of people held in cages. We know this can be done, as many other countries have shown by example that the U.S. practice of absurdly long prison sentencing contributes nothing remotely resembling rehabilitation.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;

&lt;strong&gt;Demand environmental justice&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;

There is a nationwide effort to expose prisons as industrial operation with chronic conditions that are not conducive to health and safety. The Environmental Justice (EJ) movement has spent the past three decades developing an analysis that applies the need for environmental protections to all areas of our society, including places like prisons, and begun writing those protections into laws, such as Executive Order 12898, developing EJ through the Civil Rights Act of 1964. In this analysis, the maintaining of warehouses for caged humans must be viewed as incompatible with environmental justice.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;

&lt;em&gt;A list of organizations in support of #OperationPUSH and #Juneteenth2018 can be found &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.facebook.com/permalink.php?story_fbid=145836562754514&amp;id=133851070619730&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;

&lt;strong&gt;Please contact FightToxicPrisons@gmail.com to add your organization to this call to action.&lt;/strong&gt;

The branch has made a generous donation, but we now need individual members to &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youcaring.com/stardustfamilyunited-971015&quot;&gt;donate and spread the word about the SFU crowd-fundraiser&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;

      <title>NYC GDC Statement in Support of Tariq Khan</title>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;
Tuesday, February 20, 2018&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;

To the University of Illinois Office of Student Conflict Resolution (conflictresolution@illinois.edu), Assistant Dean of Students Rony Die (ronydie@illinois.edu), and Associate Dean of Students Justin Brown (justbrow@illinois.edu):&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;

As an organization committed to defending members of the working class as they struggle for a more just world, we denounce, in the strongest possible terms, the Office of Student Conflict Resolution’s mind-boggling capitulation to the bigots waging a campaign of targeted harassment against Tariq Khan.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;

It is unconscionable that Khan is being disciplined by your office when his department and even the Champaign County Court have been able to see through the ruse of the right-wing outrage machine targeting him. Turning Point USA, the organization which Khan’s accuser belongs to, has a well-documented history of going after students, professors, and other faculty for their political beliefs, encouraging TPUSA members to mob their targets’ employers and schools with calls for dismissal and expulsion, while also harassing their targets personally through threatening calls, emails, and even stalking. After the amount of suffering that TPUSA has inflicted on Khan and his family, it is ludicrous for your office to top it off by threatening his education and livelihood.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;

Should your office be truly interested in supporting a safe and secure university environment, it should look into the well-documented history of TPUSA’s abuses and immediately suspend any disciplinary action against Khan, issue him and his family a formal apology, and commit to better protecting your community in the future.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;

In Solidarity with Tariq Khan,&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;

The New York City General Defense Committee
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;IN CASE YOU MISSED IT&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;strong&gt;Mike Pesa, a longtime member of the IWW who currently belongs to the Baltimore GMB and previously belonged to the New York City GMB, needs our support.&lt;/strong&gt; FW Mike’s wife, Heidi, a former kindergarten teacher, suffered a brain injury, and insurance will not cover the costs of her recovery. &lt;a href=&quot;https://itsgoingdown.org/longtime-wobbly-need-solidarity/&quot;&gt;Read more about it here&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.gofundme.com/helping-hands-for-heidi&quot;&gt;please donate here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;

&lt;strong&gt;The Incarcerated Workers Organizing Committee (IWOC) is fighting draconian new package restrictions in New York State prisons.&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nydailynews.com/new-york/families-forced-pay-basic-items-inmates-article-1.3706046&quot;&gt;Read more about it here&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=&quot;https://diy.rootsaction.org/petitions/no-package-restrictions-for-nys-prisoners&quot;&gt;sign a petition against it here&lt;/a&gt;.

&lt;strong&gt;In August, the NYC GDC held a successful fundraiser for J20 defendants (which include quite a few Wobblies), but more support is still needed.&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.crowdrise.com/gdc-bail-fund-for-j20/fundraiser/gdcsteeringcommittee&quot;&gt;Please donate to the GDC fund for J20 here.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;

&lt;strong&gt;The GMB is working to account for its assets (social media accounts, finance accounts, etc.) and move ownership to the branch and/or appropriate officers or committees.&lt;/strong&gt; Please email &lt;a href=&quot;mailto:nyc-iww@wobblycity.org&quot;&gt;nyc-iww@wobblycity.org&lt;/a&gt; if you currently run or have access to any of the branch’s assets.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;

Over the past decade, calls for general strikes have become a recurrent feature of the social movement landscape in the United States. In some cases, these have led to mass actions involving thousands or millions of workers. In others, they have largely failed to materialize beyond Facebook event pages. As we head into an era of right-wing control of all three branches of the federal government, increased erosion of civil rights and the right to organize, and intensified attacks on workers, women, people of color, LGBTQ, and muslims, what can a look at the past ten years of mass mobilizations tell us about how to build and exert power without friends in high places?&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;

In this panel discussion, organizers from mass strike mobilizations of the past ten years will share their reflections on what worked and what didn’t, so that we can fight to win in the intense years ahead.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Participants include:&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;strong&gt;Quebec IWW: May Day 2015 Public Sector General Strike&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;
Annabelle Sanchez and Éric Dufault were both involved in the campaign for a May Day general strike in Quebec in 2015. Through the IWW-Montreal and other social movements they helped organize one of the first political strikes in Quebec since the 1980’s. Annabelle is also part of different collectives in feminist and antifascist struggles. Éric is also a participant in the antifascist and anarchist movements. They both participated in the student movement during and before the Quebec student strike of 2012, which is one of the inspirations for the May Day strike of 2015. They also started a cultural collective together called Dure Réalité to try to spread their political values.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;

&lt;strong&gt;National Women’s Liberation: J20 Women Strike&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;
Adrielle Munger will be on strike on January 20-21, 2017 as part of the Women Strike, called by National Women’s Liberation. Taking cues from many previous successful Women’s Strikes throughout the world, this strike aims to raise consciousness about the unfair work – paid and unpaid – that falls on women, and get women organized and ready for the long fight ahead. Adrielle has been active in NWL and Redstockings (&lt;a href=&quot;Redstockings.org&quot;&gt;Redstockings.org&lt;/a&gt;) since 2013, and also organizes to fight the exploitation of unpaid interns in the Intern Worker Alliance. Adrielle works as a research assistant for the Redstockings Women’s Liberation Archives for Action in New York City, and is a freelance researcher and copyeditor. When she is not studying radical feminism and movement history, Adrielle is writing a book about the Faust Myth and the Internet. Adrielle is striking from wearing makeup, ignoring street harassment, accepting misogynist comments, and working her 3(!!) paid jobs to pay her exorbitant rent. She lives in Brooklyn, NY.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;

&lt;strong&gt;Movimiento Cosecha: General Strike for Immigrant Rights&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;
Movimiento Cosecha seeks to become a nonviolent army with the function of catalyzing immigrants and allies towards massive non­cooperation to win permanent protection, dignity and respect for immigrants in the US. Cosecha seeks to create change by winning the hearts, minds, and support of a majority of Americans and achieving active, sustained support of about 3.5% of the population. Therefore, their work and actions are focused on winning over more and more people, not politicians or CEOs. Movimiento Cosecha’s organizing is based on a four-phased strategy:&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Build support in the immigrant and ally community for a new immigration solution&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Demonstrate that political parties cannot give us what we want&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Publically affect the American economy and its dependence on immigrant &amp; ally consumers through boycotts&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Stop the country for periods of time through a general strike and massive civil disobedience until recognition and protection has been enabled&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;br&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Moderator:&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;strong&gt;Immanuel Ness&lt;/strong&gt; is Professor of political science at Brooklyn College of the City University of New York and Senior Research Associate at the Centre for Social Change, University of Johannesburg. His research focuses on migration, working class mobilization, labor movements in the Global South, urban movements of the poor and dispossessed, and socialist political theory. Ness is author of Southern Insurgency: The Coming of the Global Working Class (Pluto, 2015) and many other books.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;

Sponsored by the NYC IWW. Organized in collaboration with the all-day event, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.facebook.com/events/374328022945184/&quot;&gt;Anti-Trump Free School / Escuelita Libre Anti-Trump&lt;/a&gt;, co-organized by &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.facebook.com/FreeUniversityNYC/&quot;&gt;Free University – NYC&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.facebook.com/MaydaySpace/&quot;&gt;Mayday Space&lt;/a&gt;.

      <title>IWOC Bike Ride fundraiser – Saturday, August 27 at 9:30 AM – 5 PM</title>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;
Please bring yourself, a bike, snacks, plenty of water, and maybe a friend or two, for this 26 mile ride. We will start in the Bronx, and make our way north mostly via trails (paved and unpaved). Once we arrive in Ossining, we will explore a small exhibit in the town about Sing Sing and its use of prison labor, and then go to the outside of the prison itself for a short speakout. Then, we will eat together and some will ride the 26 miles back, while another group will take the metro north back to the city. Tickets for the metro north are $10 to $15, so plan accordingly. If the weather is particularly adverse on Saturday, we will ride Sunday. Please email:iwoc.nyc@riseup.net for any questions or updates.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;

Also please bring $5-$15 dollars as a donation to IWOC towards helping build for the strike. NO ONE TURNED AWAY FOR LACK OF FUNDS.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;

Several former workers at Beverage Plus and their supporters visited the company in Maspeth Queens this week to demand that the owner Yun Cho pay the more than $1.2 million owed to the workers from a wage theft lawsuit. Cho was present but did not come out to talk to the workers who then left a letter demanding payment. The company, which has also operated under the names YS Beverage and Grand Beverage, is a distributor in New York City, handling products such as Coca Cola and Poland Spring beverages. It was found liable in 2012 for multiple violations of the Fair Labor Standards Act for unpaid minimum wage and overtime for dozens of workers. The workers are still seeking the payments in court but have also called upon supporters to join their campaign to get the money owed to them. The workers have been long time members of the Brandworkers and NYC Industrial Workers of the World (IWW) campaign to organize and improve conditions in New York City’s food production and distribution sector.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;

Stay tuned for more actions in support of the Beverage Plus workers!

      <title>Three Ways To Win Your IWW Campaign</title>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;
By Daniel Gross&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;

The IWW has made dramatic strides in the last decade, returning to its roots as an effective and transformative labor union. Unique campaigns in diverse industries have won important gains for workers and significantly influenced the broader labor movement. Still, the building of enduring worker-led and operated industrial unions, a founding mandate of our union, has not yet been fully realized.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;

With the IWW’s strong recent track record, unparalleled experience in rank-and-file organizing, and rich learnings from our work, we are positioned to get to the next level of building durable industrial unions to scale.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;

Here are three ways we can get to the next level:&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;1. Take a Step Back&lt;/h2&gt;

Too many Wobbly campaigns start with a group of workers deciding they are going to talk to their co-workers and organize their shop. The idea is after the shop or chain is organized, they will then figure out how to organize the industry. This approach is not working because a shop is not a significant unit in our economy; industries are.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;

Instead of jumping right in to organize your shop, take a step back and look at your industry. Your job as an IWW organizer is to organize your shop, but more so, it is to co-found a successful industrial union of workers in your industry. Understand the industry, its workers, employers, customers, investors, supply chain, distribution, and so forth. Build a model to win in the industry, including at your job.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;

Once you have taken a step back you might decide that your industrial union building effort actually should start with organizing your shop or chain, and that is totally fine. You will have the roadmap to do it right and the mission’s clarity in that your ultimate project is to build an effective industrial union. On the other hand, you might decide on a totally different path into an industry that at the moment does not directly involve your employer. That is fine, too, as then you have just avoided years of misdirected effort.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;

It is completely understandable to want to get the ball rolling, fight injustice at your shop or company, and then figure out the bigger picture as you go. But, by taking a step back you will avoid the fate that has felled many Wobbly campaigns and instead, you will be investing in big, durable victories to come.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;2. Get Clarity on Your Strategy&lt;/h2&gt;

Many IWW campaigns have faltered for lack of a viable strategy or even a lack of any articulated strategy. We need to learn strategy-making in the IWW. Without finding a strategy that works for your industrial union building effort, the most courageous and hard-fought efforts will be beaten.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;

The two essential questions to formulate strategy are: where will we struggle and how will we win? “Where to struggle” means things like which industry, sector, geographic location, employers, or other stakeholders that will be our focus. “How to win” means the unique choices we make to achieve our winning objective in the field of struggle we have picked. These two strategy questions are adapted from the work of business school professor Roger Martin, which we modified in New York for use in worker organizations. A good way to start practicing with the “where to struggle” and “how to win” questions is to apply them to various worker organizing campaigns that you are familiar with, successful and unsuccessful, inside and outside the IWW.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;

More than anything, your strategy must assert the power you will need to win your demands. Asserting sufficient power is extremely difficult and will not come from generic formulations. Each industrial union effort will have to do its own thinking about this question. Differ-ent industries, sectors, workers, employers and geographies pose varied challenges and opportunities for power assertion. Always include secondary targets or influencers in your analysis. A common success factor for many worker organizing campaigns has been the ability to move those stakeholders.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;

Several IWW campaigns today have only an employer-level strategy, which is related to the need to step back, which I have discussed. Do not fall into that trap. The mission is to build an industrial union and that requires a cascade of strategies beyond your shop or employer.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;

Many industrial union building efforts will need an overall organizational strategy, an industry-level strategy, a sector-level strategy, and an employer-level strategy. You will answer the where to struggle and how to win question for each level. And each level is interrelated.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;

You should be able to write down the core of each strategy level in the ballpark of 25 words or less. This short statement will not replace a strategic plan; but, the best engines of power assertion are amenable to simple and brief articulation. It is much easier to remember and align a team of founding fellow workers around 25 words than it is 25 pages.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;

Scared you will assess and test several strategies but still choose the wrong path? You probably will. However, with a system for regular strategy reviews and the will to keep the struggle alive, you will adjust until you find the strategy that works. And adjust again if it stops working. With effective strategy-making, you and other workers will see big and game-changing results in IWW organizing.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;3. Build a Model&lt;/h2&gt;

A strategy to win is necessary but not sufficient to create an industrial union. In casual conversation, we often interchange strategy and model. We cannot afford to make that mistake in the high-stakes and incredibly difficult project of founding an industrial union. Strategy is a component of an organizational model. A model includes all of your organization’s fundamental building blocks and how they interlace.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;

Which set of workers in the industry will you and your fellow workers seek out first? What channels will you prioritize to reach those workers? How will leaders develop?&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;

If you are able to successfully assert power, what mechanism will use to define and hold the gains you win? A collective bargaining agreement? A code of conduct with large brands? A non-contractual standard, which was for example IWW Local 8’s approach on the Philadelphia waterfront?&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;

How will you tie the value created by the industrial union to being a member of the organization? How will you retain members? What will you measure to see if your vision is making progress in the messy world of reality?&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;

These are some key questions that a model must seek to answer and test. Though interrelated with strategy, hopefully, it is clear they require their own thinking and formulation. It takes a complete model for an industrial union to win, scale and endure.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;

Like strategy, the model almost never works right off the bat and that is fine. The key is to dialogue, debate, and document your model as founding co-workers and to stay alive. You will refine the model as you go and even transform it dramatically if needed. When it does click you will change your industry and your workplace, and maybe even the labor movement and the world.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;

      <title>Work to Rule. Part 3</title>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;
This is a re-post of &lt;a href=&quot;http://nyc.starbucksunion.org/work-to-rule-part-1/&quot;&gt;an article by the same name&lt;/a&gt; also published on &lt;a href=&quot;nyc.starbucksunion.org&quot;&gt;nyc.starbucksunion.org&lt;/a&gt;

&lt;hr style=&quot;margin:35px 0;&quot;&gt;


&lt;h1&gt;Behind the Line&lt;/h1&gt;

The day after Starbucks workers met at the Bat Cave we found ourselves working an understaffed morning shift but this time it was different. Instead of feeling the normal frustration, those of us who were at the meeting exchanged knowing glances and began implementing our plan of following every rule, thereby slowing down service. We also whispered to partners who were not in the know to slow down, don’t kill yourself. It was as if everyone took a deep breath and began working at a safe and thorough pace. The effects were instant. The speed of service dropped immediately. We ran out of brewed coffee because we were only brewing when the beeper signaled it was time. Everyone stayed in the positions they were assigned and acted only at the directions of the Store Manager. Every 10 minutes when someone was assigned to clean the lobby, we did a thorough job, ensuring everything was clean and properly stocked. Every drink and food order was perfect.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;

Dan, the Store Manager, lost his mind. He was running around like a crazed man. It was the most any of us had ever seen him work. The best part was he couldn’t get mad at us, not only were we doing our jobs but we were doing them exactly as we should. Each drink was made perfectly, every pastry was cooked one at a time on the correct oven setting, and each cleaning task was done exactly as it should be. We continued to do this all week. We found ourselves giggling and sharing secret exchanges of encouragement. It was common to hear “wow, look Dan is working today! Now he knows what we go through every day”. We were working as a team instead of blaming each other for a situation that none of us could control. Meanwhile, partners were calling Partner Resources. Everyone called the hotline number, with the exception of two baristas and two supervisors. We all stuck to the issues we came up with in the initial meeting, with the hope that our calls would tell a consistent story.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;

Nothing seemed to be happening but at least we felt in control. We felt like we were doing something to make our jobs and our lives better rather than hoping things would change. These were our jobs, our store and our customers, without us there would be no Starbucks. Our ability to slow down the rate of business reinforced this fact.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;

A week after we started our work to rule and coordinated contacts to Partner Resources we saw the results. An investigation was launched into our store. Dan’s bosses were in our store every day. Interestingly enough the investigation was not the result of our phone calls and complaints but because we had cut business in the store by over $10,000 that week by slowing down. Dan’s bosses were furious at the loss of business. They watched as every 5th customer left the store because the line was too long and slow moving. When baristas were asked why this was happening we all replied, “we are understaffed. We need between 7 to 9 people to do our jobs well and keep customers happy”. The next weeks schedule had already been printed but suddenly Dan was asking everyone if they want more hours. He added at least two people to every shift. After that we always had enough people scheduled to do our jobs right. Dan now knew what would happen if we were understaffed and he knew the loss of business we could cause him would likely affect his future at the company.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;

Sadly, we were not able to get Dan removed as a Store Manager, he continues to make our lives a living hell. However, the power we felt that week will not be forgotten. The ties of solidarity amongst those involved in the planning and implementation will be long lasting. We all tasted what it would be like to have control over our jobs and that can never be taken away.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;

&lt;strong&gt;Addendum:&lt;/strong&gt; Almost exactly a year from his first day at our store, Dan was removed from his position as Store Manager. Of the 21 people who participated in actions to remove him, 7 baristas had transferred, 4 were fired, and 8 quit.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;

      <title>Work to Rule. Part 2</title>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;
This is a re-post of &lt;a href=&quot;http://nyc.starbucksunion.org/work-to-rule-part-1/&quot;&gt;an article by the same name&lt;/a&gt; also published on &lt;a href=&quot;nyc.starbucksunion.org&quot;&gt;nyc.starbucksunion.org&lt;/a&gt;

&lt;hr style=&quot;margin:35px 0;&quot;&gt;

&lt;h1&gt;The Bat Cave&lt;/h1&gt;

Word of our Starbucks Store Manager, Dan, throwing a binder at an employee spread through the store like wild fire. Everyone was furious. We have tolerated inconsistent scheduling, low wages, on going verbal abuse and much more, this, however, was the last straw. We decided it was time to meet up. Enrico- a 61 year old Puerto Rican busser, Anna-a 25 year old Puerto Rican woman, Gabrielle-a 19 year old Jamaican nursing student, Alejandro- a 22 year old Dominican, Sam-a 23 year old Columbian, Thomas-a 27 year old Texan and I, a 28 year old woman from Kansas decided to meet up Tuesday after our morning shift and figure out a way to fix the problems in the store. We met at a bar down the street from work. The spot has dozens of empty pool tables and cheap drinks before 7pm, which is perfect for a group of people who are all up at 3 or 4am for work. We started frequenting this spot as a place to go and vent about work. The bartenders are all very nice and often look the other way if we don’t order any drinks and just hang out on the overstuffed couch for an hour or two after a rough shift. We started calling our spot “the Bat Cave” as we secretly spoke about ways we could take back power at work and make our jobs better. Today at the Bat Cave we pulled two tables together and Gabrielle took notes. We all decided we had had enough and it was time to take action. The group came to the conclusion to use two tactics at the same time to pressure Starbucks to fire or transfer Dan but also to immediately resolve the issue of being understaffed.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;

To implement the first tactic, we came up with a list of issues we had with Dan (&lt;a href=&quot;#appendix&quot;&gt;See appendix for complete list&lt;/a&gt;). We decided to call Partner Resources, a third party phone line that is supposed to resolve issues that affect baristas. We thought, somewhat naively, that if everyone in the store called over the next week they would have to listen to our issues and investigate. Gabrielle diligently wrote up our grievances and offered to email them out to everyone who was at the meeting. We gathered email addresses, but most importantly we came up with a list of other people in the store who would likely be interested in contacting Partner Resources with us. We divided up the list of people, so everyone at the meeting was responsible for telling a coworker about our plan. Gabrielle also drove home the fact that we should keep this secret and not talk about anything while at work. In addition, we decided to make our calls anonymously, no matter how much we were pressured to reveal our identities. We all knew that if word of our plan were to leak out we would be subjected to cut hours or write-ups, which would affect our already small raises.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;

Our second tactic was designed to address immediately the issue of understaffing. We were working ourselves to death under Dan’s reign. Our store is so big that we should always have 7-9 people scheduled to work the morning rush. Lately we have had as few as 3 and an average of only 5 people working. The result of this cost cutting measure was that the customer line reached out the door, customers were mad that service was taking so long, baristas were getting cussed at and verbally abused, we were constantly burning and cutting themselves because we were moving so fast, we often put ourselves in dangerous situations to save time, for example climbing on counters to reach supplies because it takes too long to grab the ladder, and new untrained baristas who due to the lack of training messed up orders. It was during our meeting at the Bat Cave that we decided as a group to not kill ourselves anymore for a company that did not have our best interest at heart. We decided if we were going to be arbitrarily yelled at for taking shortcuts to speed up service, we would stop. From this point on we would follow every single rule. This meant getting customer names and spelling them correctly, making each drink using the method Starbucks created-rather than the short cuts every good barista learns, we brewed coffee in a particular order according to a beeper rather than keeping an eye on things so we don’t run out of fresh coffee. We would leave the floor to change rags every two hours instead of when there is a lull in the rush and every 10 minutes someone would leave the floor to clean the lobby.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;

We adjourned the meeting feeling empowered and optimistic. We would no longer be working for a low-wage; instead we were working to rule.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Starbucks Jargon&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;Barista:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;margin-left:40px;&quot;&gt;someone who makes drinks, cleans bathrooms and the store, cashier, and stocks supplies.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;Busser:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;margin-left:40px;&quot;&gt;someone who cleans and restocks items. Starbucks has almost entirely removed this position from the company, forcing baristas to take turns cleaning and stocking while they are serving the customers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;Shift Supervisor or Shift:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;margin-left:40px;&quot;&gt;often called a barista who counts money. They run the floor and let baristas know when they can take a break and where they should be working. They also order more supplies, count money for the registers, and handle “situations” or rowdy customers as needed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;Assistant Store Manager:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;margin-left:40px;&quot;&gt;Does many of the same tasks as the Store Manager and acts as their assistant in running the store. They also do the job of a barista during their shifts.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;Store Manager:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;margin-left:40px;&quot;&gt;Is in charge of scheduling, ordering, implementing new promotions. They should also be on the floor helping baristas when we are busy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;Floor or back line:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;margin-left:40px;&quot;&gt;the area where we make drinks and serve the customers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;Back room:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;margin-left:40px;&quot;&gt;where extra products are stored and we take our breaks.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;br&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;appendix&quot;&gt;Issues we have with Dan&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Won’t allow switching of shifts. Plays favorites and lets his favorites switch shifts&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Schedules himself on the floor but isn’t on the floor.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Says that we have to leave before our scheduled end time, resulting in lost pay.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Consistently under staffs our store, Sunday’s in particular. No pre-closer, no mid-shift supervisor.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Disrespectful to partners. Threw the schedule binder. Partner was ill and was going to call out but came into work. Was feeling so dizzy had to step off the floor and fell forward. Dan told her to sit down and got another partner to get her water. She went back on the floor and said she would stay on the floor as long as possible. Was on register for another two hours. Then she went to the back to asks to go home because she isn’t feeling better. Threw the binder towards her after she asked. Anna was so upset she picked up the binder and clocked out and walked off the floor.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;When partners request days off they are scheduled anyways and then pressures into working.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Holding back tips from employees.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Dan leaves early, takes extra breaks, and stays on break longer than allotted.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Threatened to cut partner hours unless she did unscheduled overtime.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Had a supervisor create a false statement about a partner being insubordinate. Resulted in a write up.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;He said he has the authority to check bags and lockers while partners are working.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;A partner found a deposit slip in the trash. Which is against Store Manager protocol&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;A partner called out and was written up for a no call no show. Falsifying reports.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Targeting partners on tattoos when others have visible tattoos and dyed hair.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Targeting some partners for being out of uniform.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Condoning malicious treatment by a supervisor toward partners&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Allowing repeated break violations by a supervisor.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Planting non-purchased items in employees bags to endanger items.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Asking partners to quit&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Manager says he has the authority over our availability sheet. Letting us know when we can and cannot work.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Refused to give a partner a schedule change request form.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Starting rumors that threaten partner’s security.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Partners feel that their jobs are constantly in jeopardy.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Partners are being unfairly monitored to be written up.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Store manager mark outs food and eats it then yells at partners for throwing the food away when it is damaged as we are required to do.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Work to Rule. Part 1</title>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;
This is a re-post of &lt;a href=&quot;http://nyc.starbucksunion.org/work-to-rule-part-1/&quot;&gt;an article by the same name&lt;/a&gt; also published on &lt;a href=&quot;http://nyc.starbucksunion.org&quot;&gt;nyc.starbucksunion.org&lt;/a&gt;

&lt;h1&gt;The Match That Started the Fire&lt;/h1&gt;

Weekends are notoriously crazy for a Starbucks barista. These are the days when people have time to vent their frustrations from the previous workweek on some unsuspecting worker. Customers come in with their screaming children, busloads of tourists struggle to understand why a small drink would be called “tall”, and the stores themselves are almost always understaffed to handle the demand. It is therefore fitting that it was Sunday when an event triggered Starbucks baristas to engage in a clever power play to make work conditions better.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;

Anna, also lovingly known as Momma Bear for her fiercely protective attitude, is originally from Florida. She told me her story once as we walked around the neighborhood where we work; the abuse she endured at home, the rape that resulted in the birth of her son, bullying at the hands of other girls at school, and the death of her best friend. Anna has been a Starbucks barista for the last three years. She likes the job because her coworkers are nice and show her respect. She knows almost every customer who comes into our high volume store and sometimes even decorates his or her cup with hand drawn pictures. Anna’s ability to work often suffers from chronic health issues. I have worked shifts where she leaves the floor to cough-up blood. The intensity of the work we do when we are understaffed amplified by other environmental factors that come from being poor and living in the projects, causes her to fall ill and catch every cold and virus that she comes into contact with.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;

This particular Sunday, Anna needed to leave early due to illness. She had already worked shifts sick that week, but today she just couldn’t do it. She knew that she wouldn’t be paid for the hours she took off and risked losing her health care benefits by falling short of the hours required to qualify. Anna walked into the back room where our Store Manager was sitting to make a much-needed request.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;

Our Store Manager, Dan, transfer to our store four months before. We all gave him a chance to pull things together. As previously mentioned, our store is very high volume. It is common for us to serve 100 customers in a half hour and pull in $10,000 in coffee sales before 10am. Dan was in over his head, he struggled to make a single drink and if he was on the floor for more than 30 minutes he would be covered in sweat. He was scattered, barking orders that caused confusion, and refused to take advice from the many baristas who had worked in our store for over five years. The result was mass confusion, low morale and being subjected to humiliating comments from frustrated customers. Dan played favorites and if you questioned his decisions you had your hours cut or were transferred to another store. Anna knew that she jeopardized more than just that day’s pay when she made her way to the back room to ask to go home ill. But she never expected what would happen next. Anna timidly approached Dan while he was sitting at his desk pretending to check the product order forms that will nonetheless be incorrect. Not even turning to acknowledge Anna while she is explaining how she almost fainted, Anna finally made her request. The words “I need to go home” triggered Dan. For a man who never moves fast, Dan spun around at the speed of light and in his frustration flung a 3″ metal ringed binder full of paper at Anna while barking “are you really that sick?” Anna was speechless, so stunned at this childish aggression, she backed away. Retreating to the backline where the rest of us continued to work, we all agreed that she should just clock out and go home. Dan was completely out of line.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Starbucks Jargon&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;Barista:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;margin-left:40px;&quot;&gt;someone who makes drinks, cleans bathrooms and the store, cashier, and stocks supplies.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;Busser:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;margin-left:40px;&quot;&gt;someone who cleans and restocks items. Starbucks has almost entirely removed this position from the company, forcing baristas to take turns cleaning and stocking while they are serving the customers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;Shift Supervisor or Shift:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;margin-left:40px;&quot;&gt;often called a barista who counts money. They run the floor and let baristas know when they can take a break and where they should be working.
